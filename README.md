# Brief Overview of the Assignments: Data Structures in Python
This collection of assignments provides a comprehensive practice session for essential data structure operations in Python, covering:
## 1. String Manipulation:
- Reversing, finding substrings, checking for palindromes and anagrams.
- Counting vowels, words, and unique characters.
- Performing basic compression and case conversion.
- Concatenating strings without using the '+' operator.
## 2. List Operations:
- Removing elements, finding the second largest number, and counting occurrences.
- Reversing a list in-place, removing duplicates while maintaining order, and checking if a list is sorted.
- Merging sorted lists, finding intersections and unions, and shuffling elements.
## 3. Tuples and Sets:
- Finding common elements between tuples, concatenating tuples, and accessing elements within a range.
- Performing set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
## 4. Dictionaries:
- Building a dictionary to store word frequencies from a list.
- Merging dictionaries, accessing values in nested dictionaries, and sorting dictionaries based on values.
- Inverting dictionaries while handling potential duplicate values.

### These assignments effectively test your understanding of working with various data structures in Python, from basic manipulations to more advanced problem-solving.
